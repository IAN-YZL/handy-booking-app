# handy-booking-app

## 1. Introduction
Handy Booking App will try to build a customer to customer (C2C) platform, which allows tradies to post their job on the platform and then clients can search them online. The platform was decided to address the problem that it is hard for clients to find outstanding tradies, while excellent tradies cannot get order easily.
